Adds a GUI and API for player pronouns!
- Upon opening the game, players will be prompted to enter their pronouns
  - They can be changed later if needed
- Entering pronouns is more than just 'he/him' or 'she/her', you're prompted to enter **all variations** (he, him, his, himself, etc)
  - This is especially useful for **neopronouns**, if some people are unsure of the variations
- There are also a few **presets** if you're feeling lazy (which can also be used as templates for complex sets of pronouns)
- The pronouns of all players are publicly viewable on multiplayer servers via the **Pronouns GUI** (default keybind 'P')
- The mod allows other mods to access player pronouns and use them in translation files easily. This means mods that support this mod don't need to say, for example, "Player123 has dropped their items!", but can instead use the correct pronouns for each player
  - This is an obscure mod there will not be like ANY mods that use this lmao, but it's nice in concept

Depends on my Core mod, [PneumonoCore](https://modrinth.com/mod/pneumono_core)
